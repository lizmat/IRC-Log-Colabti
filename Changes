0.0.27  2021-05-19T19:51:33+02:00
    - Become a client of the new IRC::Log role, now that the API
      basically has stabilized.

0.0.26  2021-05-18T23:48:29+02:00
    - Reorganize handling of hour/minute/ordinal/pos internally
      "pos" is now part of the internal $!hmop attribute, so that
      calling .pos on an entry is not dependent on the number of
      entries, or the position of the entry in that days's entries.
    - .new now needs to be called with :hour, :minute, :ordinal
      and :pos attributes, thereby hiding how these are encoded
      internally and make a move to a role more easy.
    - Add .this-target for finding the entry with the given target

0.0.25  2021-05-13T16:43:06+02:00

0.0.23  2021-05-02T14:49:34+02:00
    - Condense hour/minute/ordinal into a single hmo attribute to
      reduce the memory footprint of each entry by about 5%.  Which
      may amount to quite a lot for channels with bigger log files.

0.0.22  2021-05-02T13:43:20+02:00
